//! Connection finite-state machine (FSM) types.
//!
//! This module defines every possible state a [`crate::connection::Connection`]
//! can occupy, mirroring the TCP state diagram (RFC 793 §3.2) adapted for our
//! protocol.  State transitions are *not* implemented here — they live in
//! [`crate::connection`] — but all legal transitions are documented as
//! `TODO` comments so they serve as a roadmap.
//!
//! Keeping state types in their own module makes it easy to add guard logic,
//! entry/exit actions, or tracing without touching connection plumbing.

/// All possible states of the connection FSM.
